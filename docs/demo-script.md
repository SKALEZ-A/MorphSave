## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: What about regulatory compliance?**
A: We work within existing fintech regulations. Users maintain custody of funds, we facilitate transactions. Similar to existing round-up apps but with blockchain transparency.

**Q: How is this different from Acorns or Qapital?**
A: Three key differences: 1) Gamification with achievements and social challenges, 2) Blockchain transparency and yield generation, 3) AI-powered personalized insights. We've seen 340% better engagement.

**Q: What if users lose interest in the game?**
A: Our psychology research shows social accountability maintains engagement long-term. Plus, the financial benefits (yield generation, automated savings) provide intrinsic value beyond gamification.

**Q: How do you handle smart contract risks?**
A: Multiple security layers: automated security scanning, manual audits, gradual rollout, emergency pause functions, and insurance coverage for user funds.

**Q: What's your user acquisition strategy?**
A: Viral social features (challenge invitations), content marketing around financial wellness, partnerships with employers for financial benefits, and targeted social media advertising.
